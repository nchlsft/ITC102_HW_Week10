Business Idea

My business will specialize in upcycling old furniture and the domain name will be emeraldupcycle.com. 
The name Emerald Upcycle was chosen because it reflects its connection to seattle and states something about 
what the business provides. Customers will be able to bring us their old, used, and worn furniture and we 
will repaint, repair and customize it to their liking. On our website they will be able to get estimates by 
uploading pictures and explaining what they would like to be done. They will also be able to view past projects 
in our portfolio that will also be displayed on the website.

Emerald Upcycle will be marketed as a green company. It will emphasize its products and the recycling process 
instead as an alternative for buying new furniture. We will also have an app that will let you submit a photo 
of your furniture and list options and suggestions on how to makeover your furniture.
